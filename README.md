## Setup

### With Docker

1. [Set up Git](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/set-up-git)

2. Install and start [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop)

3. Clone the project and build the Docker images

```zsh
git clone https://github.com/rubberdok/indok-web.git
cd indok-web
docker compose build
```

4. Run the project in Docker and set up the database

```zsh
docker compose up
docker compose exec backend python manage.py loaddata initial_data
```

The last command creates some initial data, two test users, and one admin user:

| Username      | Password | Ind√∏k |
| ------------- | :------: | ----: |
| eva_student   |   5tgb   |  true |
| asbjorn_elevg |   1qaz   | false |
| admin         | admin123 | super |

- Accessing the test users

  - Log in with Feide > Feide Test Users (under "Other login alternatives")

  - Enter the respective username and password.

5. Install pre-commit hooks and Node dependencies locally for linting
   - If you already have `yarn` installed, skip to step 4.
   1. Install `nvm` by following the [instructions](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating)
   2. Install Node 16
   ```zsh
   nvm install 16
   nvm use 16
   ```
   3. Install `yarn`
   ```zsh
   npm i -g yarn
   ```
   4. Install pre-commit hooks and dependencies locally
   ```zsh
   cd frontend
   yarn
   ```
6. Install Python dependencies locally for linting
   1. Install [Python 3.9](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-397/)
   2. (Optional, but recommended) Create a virtual environment in the root folder `indok-web`
   ```zsh
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```
   3. Install Python dependencies locally
   ```zsh
   pip install -r backend/requirements/local.txt
   ```

The frontend runs on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000), and the backend on [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000). The GraphQL API endpoint is [http://localhost:8000/graphql](http://localhost:8000/graphql). The admin panel is available at [http://localhost:8000/admin](http://localhost:8000/admin).

### Without Docker

Some users, particularly those using Windows, may have issues running the app through Docker. Some functionality such as
hot reloading (which drastically improves developer experience) only work when you have the whole project in WSL
(Windows Subsystem for Linux, which is what Docker on Windows uses). Therefore, you may prefer to run the project
without Docker ‚Äî in that case, follow the below steps to set up the frontend, backend and database locally.

Before following the steps below, make sure to clone the project with Git:

1. In the terminal, move to where you want to store the project (easiest is just where you are when you open the
   terminal)
2. Type `git clone https://github.com/rubberdok/indok-web.git`
   - This creates a new folder named `indok-web`, which contains the project
3. Type `cd indok-web` to move into the new folder
4. If using VSCode, you can type `code .` to open the current folder in VSCode

#### Database

The project uses PostgreSQL as its database. Even when running the frontend and backend outside of Docker, we still
recommend running Postgres through Docker, since you don't need hot reloading there and it makes the setup simpler.

To set up PostgreSQL in Docker, follow these steps:

1. Download, install and start Docker Desktop: https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
2. Navigate to `indok-web` in the terminal (`cd indok-web`)
3. Type `docker compose up postgres`
4. Open the `indok-web` folder in VSCode
5. Make a new file called `.env` inside `backend`
6. Paste the following line in that file, and save:

```
DB_HOST=localhost
```

Now Postgres should be up and running! Leave the terminal window open to keep the database running in the background.

If you want to close the database, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal running Postgres, or type `docker compose down`
inside the `indok-web` folder in another terminal. To start Postgres again, type `docker compose up postgres`, also in
the `indok-web` folder (and make sure Docker Desktop is running!). If you want to clear the database, go to the
`Volumes` tab in Docker Desktop, and delete `indok-web_postgres_data`

If you still want to run Postgres without Docker, download and install it from here instead: https://www.postgresql.org/download/. Then follow steps 4-6 as above.

#### Backend

1. Download and install `pyenv` (Python version manager): https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv#installation
   - If on Windows, install `pyenv-win` instead: https://github.com/pyenv-win/pyenv-win#installation
   - Type `pyenv --version` in a new terminal to check that it was installed correctly
2. Type `pyenv install --list | grep " 3.9"` to get the list of available Python 3.9 versions
   - If on Windows, type `pyenv install --list | findstr " 3.9"` instead
3. Type `pyenv install 3.9.X`, where `X` is the latest version found from the previous step
4. Type `pyenv global 3.9.X`, where `X` is the same as the previous step
   - If you do not want to use Python 3.9 globally, type `pyenv local 3.9.X` instead (make sure you are in the
     `indok-web` folder when you do this)
   - Type `python --version` to verify that it has been set to `3.9.X`
5. Type `cd indok-web/backend` to move into the backend folder (or just `cd backend` if you were already in `indok-web`)
6. Type `python -m venv venv`
   - This sets up a Python virtual environment, to isolate this project from others
7. Type `source venv/bin/activate` to activate the virtual environment
   - If on Windows, type `.\venv\scripts\activate` instead
8. Type `python -m pip install -r requirements/local.txt` to install dependencies
   - If on Windows, also install the GTK3 runtime from the `.exe` here:
     https://github.com/tschoonj/GTK-for-Windows-Runtime-Environment-Installer/releases (one of the Python libraries we
     use depends on this)
9. Set the environment variable `DJANGO_READ_DOT_ENV_FILE` to `true`
   - On Mac/Linux:
     - Type `code ~/.zshrc` to open the `zsh` config
     - Paste this line somewhere in that file: `export DJANGO_READ_DOT_ENV_FILE=true`
     - Save the file, and re-open the terminal
   - On Windows:
     - Use the Windows search bar to search for "environment variables" (Norwegian: "milj√∏variabler")
     - Click the "Edit the system environment variables" result
     - Click "Environment variables..." (may not be necessary, if you were brought directly to the environment variable overview)
     - Click "New" under "User variables"
     - Set variable name as `DJANGO_READ_DOT_ENV_FILE` and variable value as `true`
     - Click OK through all the windows
10. Ask the project maintainers for dev environment variables (not strictly required, but step 14 will not work without this)
    - If you're a member of Rubberd√∏k:
      - Go to the `#dev` channel in Slack
      - Find the pinned post with dev environment variables
      - Copy the variables for `backend/.env` into your own `.env` file in `indok-web/backend` (make sure not to overwrite the `DB_HOST` variable from the database setup)
11. Type `python manage.py runserver` to run the backend server
    - If it fails, make sure that you:
      - are in the `indok-web/backend` folder
      - have your virtual environment active
      - have the database running
12. Open a new terminal (leave the previous terminal open to keep the server running!)
    - Type `cd indok-web/backend` to get back to the backend folder
    - Type `source venv/bin/activate` (Mac) or `.\venv\scripts\activate` (Windows) to re-activate the virtual environment in this new terminal
13. Type `python manage.py migrate` to update the database with our backend models
14. Type `python manage.py loaddata initial_data` to load example data into the database
    - This also creates an admin user with username `admin` and password `admin123`

Now the backend should be running at `localhost:8000`! You can check out the GraphQL API at `localhost:8000/graphql`, or
use the Django admin panel at `localhost:8000/admin` (log in with the admin user from step 14).

If you want to close the backend, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it runs. To start it again:

1. Move into the backend folder (`cd indok-web/backend`)
2. Activate your virtual environment
   - On Mac: `source venv/bin/activate`
   - On Windows: `.\venv\scripts\activate`
3. Type `python manage.py runserver`
4. If you need to run migrations:
   - Open a new terminal, and repeat steps 1 and 2
   - If you've made changes to Django models and want to generate new migrations: `python manage.py makemigrations`
   - Run migrations with `python manage.py migrate`

#### Frontend

1. Download and install `nvm` (Node Version Manager): https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm#installing-and-updating
   - If on Windows, install `nvm-windows` instead: https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows/releases
     - Scroll down on that page to find `nvm-setup.exe`, and download it
     - Open the terminal **as administrator** (`PowerShell`/`Command Prompt`/`Windows Terminal`)
     - Use `cd` to navigate to where you downloaded the `.exe` file (e.g. `cd downloads`)
     - Type `.\nvm-setup.exe`, and go through the installer
   - Type `nvm version` in a new terminal to check that it was installed correctly
2. Type `nvm install 16` in the terminal to install Node.js version 16
3. Type `nvm use 16.X.Y`, where `16.X.Y` is the version shown in the terminal after running the previous command
   - If on Windows, you may have to run the terminal as administrator
4. Open the `indok-web` folder in VSCode, and create a file called `.env.local`
5. Ask the project maintainers for dev environment variables
   - If you're a member of Rubberd√∏k:
     - Go to the `#dev` channel in Slack
     - Find the pinned post with dev environment variables
     - Copy the variables for `frontend/.env.local` into your own `.env.local` file in `indok-web/backend`
6. Type `cd indok-web/frontend` to move into the frontend folder (or just `cd frontend` if you were already in indok-web)
7. Type `npm install -g yarn`
   - This installs Yarn, which we use to manage dependencies in the frontend
8. Type `yarn` to fetch dependencies
9. Type `yarn dev` to run the frontend

Now the frontend should be running at `localhost:3000`! You can check it out in the web browser.

If you want to close the frontend, press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal where it runs. To start it again, type `yarn dev`
inside `indok-web/frontend` (if dependencies have changed, you may have to run `yarn` first).

### Secrets

Environment variables are automatically loaded, but secrets are not stored in the repository.

1. Create a file called `.env` in the `backend` folder, and a file called `.env.local` in `frontend`.
2. Contact maintainers in order to get the necessary secrets.
   - If you're a member of Rubberd√∏k, check the `#dev` channel on Slack.
3. When you make changes to `.env` files, make sure to restart the frontend and backend if you have them running
